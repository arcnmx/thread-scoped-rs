# thread-scoped

[![travis-badge][]][travis] [![release-badge][]][cargo] [![docs-badge][]][docs] [![license-badge][]][license]

A `std::thread::spawn()` that can access its current scope.
Stable fork of the deprecated `std::thread::scoped()`


## Memory Unsafety

This interface is inherently unsafe if the `JoinGuard` is allowed to leak without being dropped.
See [rust-lang/rust#24292](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24292) for more details.


## Alternatives

This crate is only provided as a fallback mirror for legacy dependency on the
deprecated `libstd` interface. Using a modern and safe API instead is recommended:

- [crossbeam::scope](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam) exposes a truly
  safe interface for sharing the stack with a spawned thread.
- [Rayon](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rayon) is a high level data-parallelism
  library.
